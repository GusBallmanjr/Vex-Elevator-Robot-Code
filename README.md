# Vex-Elevator-Robot-Code
This code is in Robot C and was my first "real" programming experience. I was taking a robotics class (7th Grade) and alone did the challenge elevator project.

Elevator Challenge Project: "A company would like to begin producing residential elevators. Your team must design the control system and a prototype of an elevator that can go between three floors in any combination. 
The prototype must include a set of three switches to represent each floor of the elevator. Each floor the elevator stops at must have a call button and a set of three lights to indicate where the elevator is currently located. 
A built-in safety mechanism requires that the elevator normally rest on the ground floor and return to the ground floor after a user-determined period of non-use."

I designed my elevator with all of these specifications, however, I added a fourth floor. Each floor had a corresponding button and one that button was pushed, the elevator would move up to that floor, wait a little bit and then travel back down to the ground floor.
